# tl-comp-challenge-3

## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a site that mimics the layout of a static comp. Creative decisions were allowed on copy, images, icons and colors. Other aspects of the final goal were meant to replicate the comp to the greatest extent possible. On this project, I emphasized becoming more comfortable creating responsive layouts on a variety of different screen sizes while maintaining the intention and readability of content.
